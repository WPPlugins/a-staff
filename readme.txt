== Frequently asked questions ==

= How can I add staff members? =

Just go to **Staff Members » Add New**. It works in the same way as adding posts or pages.

= How can I add social network icons to the profiles? =

First you have to register them under **Settings » a-staff Settings » Social**. With the Add Social Network plugin you can add new networks to the system.
You can specify the display name and the icon for each network here.
After you've set up the social networks, you can go to the Staff Members area and set the links to the profiles of each member.

= Where can I add the member's bio? =

The Excerpt is used as the member's bio text in the shortcode. It means that if you don't specify the excerpt then the auto-generated excerpt (based on The Content) will be used.
From v1.1 you can use formatted bio, which leaves some basic inline formatting in the excerpt, together with line breaks. In this case you can set the maximum length for the excerpt, too.

== Screenshots ==

4. This is how the shortcode looks like in the front end
